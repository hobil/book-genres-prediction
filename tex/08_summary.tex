\section{Summary and Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Looked at text genre classification into $14$ classes of documents of sizes $200$, $800$ and $3200$ characters
    \item The classification accuracy grew with increasing length of the documents indicating the algorithms had difficulties to recognize genre from only a short snippet.
    \item Bigger gap in performance between documents with $200$ and $800$ words than between $800$ and $3200$ words.
    \item Feed-forward neural net on feature vectors outperforms logistic regression but not by much\dots
    \item Provided insights into what is typical for each genre (typical words)
    \item Deployed couple of classifiers to heroku with web interface
\end{itemize}
